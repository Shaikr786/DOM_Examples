# 📘 DOM\_Examples

This repository contains basic examples of using the **DOM (Document Object Model)** in JavaScript to interact with and manipulate HTML elements dynamically. It's designed as a beginner-friendly project to demonstrate core DOM manipulation techniques, event handling, and dynamic behavior in web pages.


## 📁 Project Structure

```
DOM_Examples/
├── index.html         # Main HTML file containing various DOM elements
├── style.css          # Optional CSS file for styling (if included)
└── script.js          # JavaScript file demonstrating DOM interactions
```

## 🎯 Objectives

* Show how JavaScript can dynamically change HTML content, style, and structure.
* Demonstrating and practicing common operations like:

  * Selecting elements using `getElementById`, `querySelector`, etc.
  * Modifying element properties and inner content.
  * Handling events such as `click`, `mouseover`, etc.
  * Creating and appending new DOM elements.

##  Outcomes

* Understanding the structure of an HTML document through the DOM.
* Dynamically updating content using JavaScript.
* Adding interactivity through event listeners.
* Using JavaScript to control web page layout and behavior in real time.


##  How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shaikr786/DOM_Examples.git
   cd DOM_Examples
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in a browser**

   * You can simply double-click the file or open it via a live server extension in VS Code.


## 🛠 Requirements

* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
* A basic text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code)


## 🧾 Example Features

* Changing text content with a button click.
* Dynamically adding new HTML elements.
* Handling mouse and keyboard events.
* Simple DOM animations or style changes.

## 📌 Ideal For

* Beginners in web development.
* Students learning JavaScript and the DOM API.
* Developers refreshing their understanding of client-side scripting.
